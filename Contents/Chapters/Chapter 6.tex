\section{Adding comments}

LaTeX is a form of “program code”, but one which specializes in document typesetting; consequently, as with code written in any other programming language, it can be very useful to include comments within your document. A \LaTeX\ comment is a section of text that will not be typeset or affect the document in any way—often used to add “to do” notes; include explanatory notes; provide in-line explanations of tricky macros or comment-out lines/sections of LaTeX code when debugging.

To make a comment in \LaTeX, simply write a \verb|%| symbol at the beginning of the line, as shown in the following code which uses the example above:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{verbatim}
    \documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}
    \title{My first LaTeX document}
    \author{Hubert Farnsworth\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}}
    \date{August 2022}
    \begin{document}
    \maketitle
    We have now added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX\{} 
    document!

    % This line here is a comment. It will not be typeset in 
    the document.
    \end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

This example produces output that is identical to the previous LaTeX code which did not contain the comment.
