This introductory tutorial does not assume any prior experience of \LaTeX\ but, hopefully, by the time you are finished, you will not only have written your first \LaTeX\ document but also acquired sufficient knowledge and confidence to take the next steps toward \LaTeX\ proficiency.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{\underline{Note \arabic*:}}]  
    \item The Overleaf article \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}{Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes} does not contain \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Page_numbering}{page numbering}, \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX}{bibliography management}, \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Questions/Using_%5Cverb_to_typeset_the_text_of_LaTeX_commands}{command typesetting}, etc. These features are added during the copywriting of the article contents.
    \item This document is constructed in \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf online editor} using \verb|pdfLaTeX| compiler under TeX Live version 2023.
    \item For offline preparations of documents using LaTeX, a supported TeX distribution is required and could be obtained from \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{The \LaTeX\ Project} website \cite{The_LaTeX_Project_get}. It is also possible to use a text editor such as Visual Studio Code to utilise its advantages in preparing a document with LaTeX \cite{Lee_2023}.
